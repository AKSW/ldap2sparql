This project is about combining the strenghts in technology of LDAP and the Semantic Web.

In order to exploit the client support of LDAP directories with the semantic expressivity of RDF knowledge bases, 
we aim at integrating RDF knowledge bases into LDAP directory services. 
LDAP 2 SPARQL is a Backend to the widely used OpenLDAP server. 
It translates LDAP queries into SPARQL queries, asks a SPARQL endpoint and translates the result back to LDIF.

For the installation guide, please use the corresponding wiki pages.
